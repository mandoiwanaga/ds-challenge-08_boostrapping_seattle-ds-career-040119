# Bootstrapping Challenge

Our statistic of choice is average goals allowed by a soccer team with defensive aggression rating >65. We are interested in calculating the 95% confidence interval.

We assumed the following:
- We only looked at teams with defensive aggression rating > 65.
- sample size on our data : 50 matches
- Number of samples :  100

Our work and results at the following:
